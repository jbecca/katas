# katas
Collection of katas and some tools for managing them. While there will be a fair amount of programming puzzle type katas, I also plan on including many examples that are not puzzles, but instead daily programming tasks like simple file parsing, creating quick CLI tools and so on. 

Extremely lofty goals include having a tool that generates input in which the katas can be tested against and proven as passed or failed, with some form of spaced repetition included. 

## Current TODOs
- [x] Add command for creating database if not present
- [x] Set up default location for database (use configuration file for this)
- [ ] Add in database helper functions for logging new katas
- [ ] Add in database helper functions for getting stats on katas
- [ ] Add trivial spaced repetition algorithm
- [ ] Create interface with CLI for grabbing katas to retest
- [ ] Figure out way to have user defined katas instead of all hardcoded
